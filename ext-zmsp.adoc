=== Zmsp*: Matrix Sparsity Extension

The Zmspa extension allows to perform 2:4 sparsing for left matrix.

The Zmspb extension allows to perform 2:4 sparsing for right matrix.

The Zmsp* extension adds two unprivileged CSRs, two configuration instructions, and two groups of matrix multiplication instructions, both for left matrix and right matrix.

.Sparsity CSRs
[cols="^2,^2,^2,10",options="header"]
|===
| Address | Privilege | Name   | Description
|  0xC4E  |    URO    | mtsp   | Source tile register for sparsing index.
|  0xC4F  |    URO    | mdsp   | The direction of sparsity (0 for row and 1 for column).
|===

==== Configuration Instructions

The Zmsp* extension adds two configuration instruction to configure the source index register and sparsity direction.

```
# Set sparsing index source register.
msettspi  rd, imm   # rd = new mtsp, imm = register index
msettsp   rd, rs1   # rd = new mtsp, rs1 = register index

# Set sparsity direction.
msetdspi  rd, imm   # rd = new mdsp, imm = direction
msetdsp   rd, rs1   # rd = new mdsp, rs1 = direction
```

An implementation may support one of sparsity directions or both two directions. The `msetdsp[i]` always returns the supported direction.

==== Matrix Multiplication Instructions

The Zmspa extension adds a group of matrix multiplication instructions for left matrix sparsity.
