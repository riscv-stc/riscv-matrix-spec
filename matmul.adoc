Matrix Multiplication operations take two matrix tiles from matrix **tile registers** specified by `ms1` and `ms2` respectively, and the output matrix tile is a matrix **accumulation register** specified by `md`.

```
# Unigned integer matrix multiplication and add, md = md + ms1 * ms2.
mmau.[dw].mm   md, ms1, ms2        # unsigned int64, output no-widen
mmau.[w].mm    md, ms1, ms2        # unsigned int32, output no-widen
mmau.[h].mm    md, ms1, ms2        # unsigned int16, output no-widen
mqmau.[b].mm   md, ms1, ms2        # unsigned int8, output quad-widen
momau.[hb].mm  md, ms1, ms2        # unsigned int4, output oct-widen

msmau.[dw].mm  md, ms1, ms2        # unsigned int64, output no-widen and saturated
msmau.[w].mm   md, ms1, ms2        # unsigned int32, output no-widen and saturated
msmau.[h].mm   md, ms1, ms2        # unsigned int16, output no-widen and saturated
msqmau.[b].mm  md, ms1, ms2        # unsigned int8, output quad-widen and saturated

# Signed integer matrix multiplication and add, md = md + ms1 * ms2.
mma.[dw].mm    md, ms1, ms2        # signed int64, output no-widen
mma.[w].mm     md, ms1, ms2        # signed int32, output no-widen
mma.[h].mm     md, ms1, ms2        # signed int16, output no-widen
mqma.[b].mm    md, ms1, ms2        # signed int8, output quad-widen

msma.[dw].mm   md, ms1, ms2        # signed int64, output no-widen and saturated
msma.[w].mm    md, ms1, ms2        # signed int32, output no-widen and saturated
msma.[h].mm    md, ms1, ms2        # signed int16, output no-widen and saturated
msqma.[b].mm   md, ms1, ms2        # signed int8, output quad-widen and saturated
msoma.[hb].mm  md, ms1, ms2        # signed int4, output oct-widen and saturated

# Float point matrix multiplication and add, md = md + ms1 * ms2.
mfma.[d].mm    md, ms1, ms2        # 64-bit float point
mfma.[f].mm    md, ms1, ms2        # 32-bit float point
mfma.[hf].mm   md, ms1, ms2        # 16-bit float point

mfwma.[f].mm   md, ms1, ms2        # 32-bit float point, output double-widen
mfwma.[hf].mm  md, ms1, ms2        # 16-bit float point, output double-widen
mfwma.[cf].mm  md, ms1, ms2        # 8-bit float point, output double-widen
mfqma.[cf].mm  md, ms1, ms2        # 8-bit float point, output quad-widen
```

A subset of these instructions is supported according to the implemented standard extensions (Zmi4, Zmi8, etc.).

The field `frm` from `fcsr` indicates the rounding mode of float-point matrix instructions. The encoding is shown below.

[cols="^1,^1,<4"]
|===
| *frm* | *Mnemonic* | *Meaning*
|  000  |  RNE       | Round to Nearest, ties to Even
|  001  |  RTZ       | Round towards Zero
|  010  |  RDN       | Round Down (towards stem:[-\infty])
|  011  |  RUP       | Round Up (towards stem:[+\infty])
|  100  |  RMM       | Round to Nearest, ties to Max Magnitude
|  101  |            | Invalid
|  110  |            | Invalid
|  111  |            | Invalid
