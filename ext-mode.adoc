=== Zma*b*: Matrix Mode Extension

The Zmab extension allows to use `C = A x B` mode for matrix multiplication, where the setting of `mcsr.mmode = 00` is legal.

The Zmabt extension allows to use `C = A x BT` mode for matrix multiplication, where the setting of `mcsr.mmode = 01` is legal.

The Zmatb extension allows to use `C = AT x B` mode for matrix multiplication, where the setting of `mcsr.mmode = 10` is legal.
